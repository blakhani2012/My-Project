CLASS

</h3>
<pre>
    
    
 --> Class is a definition block which define state and behaviour  of object   
    
 --> Non static data member defines the state of object.  
    
 --> Non static function member define behaviour of object.  


</pre>
<h2>Member of Class</h2>
<pre>

Class has two types of member
  1.static member
  2.non static member
  </pre>
  
  <h2>static member</h2>
  <pre>
  --> using static keyword you can define static data member or function member
  
  --> static member always associated with a class.
      so it refer through class.

  --> when you declare member as static then only one copy created in memory 
      and that is modifiable.
      
  --> whenever we want only single copy we go through static member.
    
  --> static member are also used to share data or function across object.  
 
 </pre>
 
 <h2> non static member.</h2>
 <pre>
  
  --it declare without static keyword.
  
  --non static member associated with an instance. Hence we need    to create instance in order to non static data member.
  
  --when ever we create instance of class, copy of class created in memory(only non static member)
    
  --modifying the data member of one instance will not affect to other instance.  

</pre>
<h2>How to access static  member</h2>
<pre>
package object;

import thread.mainclass;

public class Static 
{

	static int id=50;
	static String name="bhavesh";
	
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
	
		//accessing static member
		
		System.out.println("Hello "+Static.name);
		
		System.out.println("your id is "+Static.id);
		
	}
	
}

output:

Hello bhavesh
your id is 50

</pre>

<h2>How to access Non static member</h2>
<pre>
package object;

public class A 
{

	//non static member
	int k=10;
	
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		A a=new A();
		
		//accessing non static property
		System.out.println("k value "+a.k);
		
	}
}

output:
k value 10
