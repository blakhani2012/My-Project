Inheritance

</h3>
<pre>

--> Class acuired property of another class is known as inheritance.

--> class can inherit from any class using extends keyword

--> there are four types of inheritance

 1.single level inheritance
 
--> in single level inheritance subclass inherit from only one super class 
    
 2.multilevel inheritance
 
--> subclass inherit from super class which inherit from another superclass

 3.multiple inheritance (java does  not support multiple inheritance)
 
--> subclass inherit more than one super class

 4.hierarchical inheritance
 
--> in this type of inheritance property of superclass is inherited to 
    more than one sub class
</pre>

 <h2>Why java does not support multiple inheritance</h2>
  <pre>
  
--> To avoid ambiguity java does not support multiple inheritance. 

--> and if you want to call more than one super class constructor then you
    require two super() statement and multiple super is not allowed so multiple
    inheritance is not support in java.
 
--> Another reason diamond problem consider below scenario.
 
   consider a scenario where a, b, c  and d are four classes. 
   the b and c class inherits a class. now consider d inherit b and c.
 
   now b and c both class have common property of a now there is ambiguity 
   at class d which property should came in d class.
  
   so java does not support multiple inheritance.
