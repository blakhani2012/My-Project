<h2>
ABSTRACTION:
</h2>

<pre>


   Abstraction is a process of hiding the class implementation from its 
utilization. The abstraction specified that do not show how object 
functionality is implemented but provide an interface to use the 
functionality.

    To achieved the abstraction we have to follow the below steps: 
 
 1) Generalize the behavior of the classes in an interface. 
 2) Provide implementation in the class according to the specification 
 3) Refer that implementation of the class by using interface reference 
    variable

    <h2>How can we Achieve Abstraction ? </h2>
   <pre>
       
 1) The abstraction can be achieved either by using abstract class or 
    interfaces  
 2) If we need pure abstraction then we should use interfaces.
    If we need concrete an abstract method then we should go for abstract
    class 
    
</pre>


<h2>Advantages of abstraction:</h2>
<pre>
 
--> We can achieved generalization 
--> We can hide the implementation 
--> We can achieve loose coupling between the objects.
--> The abstraction is used to developed APIâ€™s(Application Programming Interfaces) 
--> The other major advantage of abstraction is any changes in the implementation
    will have very less impact on the utilization of the class.
