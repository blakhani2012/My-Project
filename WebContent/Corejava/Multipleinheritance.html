Multiple inheritance

<pre>Multiple inheritance not supported in java</pre>

<h2>Why java does not support multiple inheritance</h2>

<pre>
  
--> To avoid ambiguity java does not support multiple inheritance. 

--> and if you want to call more than one super class constructor then you
    require two super() statement and multiple super is not allowed so multiple
    inheritance is not support in java.
 
--> Another reason diamond problem consider below scenario.
 
   consider a scenario where a, b, c  and d are four classes. 
   the b and c class inherits a class. now consider d inherit b and c.
 
   now b and c both class have common property of a now there is ambiguity 
   at class d which property should came in d class.
  
   so java does not support multiple inheritance.
