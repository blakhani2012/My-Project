<h3>

Polymorphysm
</h3>
<pre>

  
 --> an object showing different behaviuor at different stages of its life cycle
     is known as polymorphysm.
  
 -->Two types of polymorphism
         1.compile time polymorphism
         2.run time polymorphism 
  
  </pre>
  
 <h3>compiletime polymorphism</h3>
 <pre>
 
--> in compiletime polymorphysm method declaration is binded to method implementation at the time of  compilation by compiler.
  
--> this type of binding is known as static binding or early binding.
  
--> the compile time binding happen for static method,final method and  overload method.
  
--> the binding done at compile time can not be re-binded.
  
--> example of compiletime polymorphism
    ~method overloading
    ~constructor overloading
    ~static method and final method
 </pre> 
  
  <h3>Runtime polymorphysm</h3>
  <pre>
  
  --> in runtime polymorphysm method body is binded to method implementation at runtime based on instance created.
   
  --> this type of binding known as dynamic binding or late binding.
   
  --> method overriding is example of runtime polymorphysm.
   
  --> to achieve runtime polymorphism we need to full feel following concept
      1.inheritance
      2.method overriding
      3.upcasting
    
  --> with the help of runtime polymorphysm u can achieve
     -generalization
     -abstraction
     -loose coupling
