Constructor

</h3>
<pre>
   
 
--> Constructor is special member of class,it is used to initialize data member of class
     at time of object creation.
   
--> every class must have constructor either user define or compiler define(defaoult consctructor)
  
--> constructor define by programmer is known user define constructor.
    where as constructor define by compiler is known as default constructor.

--> if user not define constructor then compiler automatically define default constructor

    constructor                   

--> constructor define with parameter is known as parametarized constructor.
    parametarized constructor used to pass value in constructor.


--> constructor name same as  class name

--> Constructor has no return type
</pre>
<h2> Constructor overloading</h2>

<pre>

--> in a class we can define any number of constructor is know as overloaded 
    constructor.

--> whenever we create overloaded constructor argument should be diffrr in
    terms argument type or argument length.

--> the overloaded constructor are used to create object with different 
    initialization

--> constructor returns the object address which is constructed by constructor
    of class.
